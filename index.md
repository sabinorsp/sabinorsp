## This project aims to develop a model for classifying cells as either malignant or benign.

This project went through several stages, including exploratory analysis, data pre-processing, model selection, model evaluation, and final classification model selection. The data used in this project was sourced from Kaggle  ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erdemtaha/cancer-data)) and includes geometric characteristics of cancer cells that were classified as either benign or malignant.
